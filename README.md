## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to serve as an open-source platform for testing Nonlinear Control Systems for Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) to enhance engineering education. There is currently a large variety of UAV hardware and 
simulation systems available, however, many have restrictions that make them difficult to use for classroom environments. 
Many simulation systems require prerequisite software dependencies to run making it difficult to repeat setup across systems. 
Working with hardware in a classroom environment presents its own set of difficulties. UAV's commonly used in research 
are notoriously dangerous in very close quarters. Flying multiple, or even one UAV inside a classroom presents a huge liability 
for student safety. Furthermore, flying most UAV's indoors is expressly prohibited by many buildings without a proper 
flight-cage.    

With all of this in mind, the project was built with the following constraints in mind:
- The project should have both hardware and simulation elements based off Python 3.
- None of the elements should be prohibitively expensive.
- Hardware should be small with as little potential for danger as possible.
- Simulation is built on an open-source physics engine.
- All software is OS agnostic.

## Installation  
This installtion guide assumes one of the following:
- There is a fresh installation of Python 3 on the host PC.
- There is a fresh Python 3 virtual environment (recommended).
- The user can troubleshoot conflicting dependencies if not using a fresh environment.  

If none of these things are true, guides for installing Python 3 and using the Virtual Environment 
manager can be found in the [Guides Section](https://github.com/JadinTredup/droneNLedu/Guides).
